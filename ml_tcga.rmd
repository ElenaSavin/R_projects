This analysis is focused on the TCGA clinical Data from patients in all projects .  
The data was downloaded from the TCGA using the TCGAbiolinks library.  
My MSc project is analysis of all the RNA-seq data on the TCGA and therefore analysis of the clinical metadata will give my project a bigger and wider picture of the results.   

### Import and primary clean
uploading the necessary libraries.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(skimr)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)
library(ROCR)
library(psych)
```

My dataset includes all TCGA clinical data. the data was downloaded directly from the tcga using TCGAbiolinks package and saved into a csv file "clinical_data_TCGA.csv" attached.  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(TCGAbiolinks)
dataset_list <- as.factor(grep("^TCGA-", 
                               getGDCprojects()$project_id, value = TRUE))
for (dataset in dataset_list) {
  print(dataset)
  data <- GDCquery_clinic(project = dataset, type = "clinical")
  value <- assign(paste(dataset, "clinical", sep = "_"), data)
}

```

Merging them- my final Data set for work is clinical_data_TCGA 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
list <- Filter(function(x) is(x, "data.frame"), mget(ls()))
clinical_data_TCGA <- bind_rows(list)
write.csv(clinical_data_TCGA, "clinical_data_TCGA.csv", na = "NA")
```
  
Reading the data into a data frame, where na is all the places where there is a missing value, space or explicitly "NA".
```{r}
clinical_data_TCGA <- read.csv("clinical_data_TCGA.csv", 
                               stringsAsFactors = T, na.strings=c(""," ","NA"))
skim(clinical_data_TCGA)
```
  
Leaving in the data frame only the features with less than 1000 NAâ€™s - these features have a lot of the data missing, therefore do not contribute enough to the dataset.  
Removing all rows with NA's to avoid missing values issues.  
```{r}
clinical_data_TCGA <- select_if(clinical_data_TCGA, funs(sum(is.na(.)) <= 1000))
clinical_data_TCGA <- as.data.frame(unclass(clinical_data_TCGA))
clinical_data_TCGA <- na.omit(clinical_data_TCGA)
```
  
Taking a look at the variables left. there are 39 features left. next i will use manual feature selection to remove redundant or unproductive features.    
```{r}
str(clinical_data_TCGA)
```

### Feature selection  
The id columns give no additive information, and are keys to other datasets available on the GDC, for example the diagnosis_id is the patients id in the diagnosis dataset (description: https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data_Dictionary/viewer/#?view=table-definition-view&id=diagnosis)  
days_to_birth gives the same information as age at index.
other variables removed have only one value.
```{r}
clinical_data_TCGA <- dplyr::select(clinical_data_TCGA, -updated_datetime, 
                                    -icd_10_code, -progression_or_recurrence ,
                      -tumor_grade, -days_to_diagnosis, -classification_of_tumor, 
                      -state, -last_known_disease_status, -diagnosis_id, 
                      -exposure_id, -demographic_id, 
                      -treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_id, 
                      -treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_type,
                      -bcr_patient_barcode, 
                      -treatments_radiation_treatment_id, 
                      -treatments_radiation_treatment_type, -alcohol_history, 
                      -days_to_birth, -submitter_id, -X)
str(clinical_data_TCGA)
```

Randomizing the data to avoid incline or specific grous only in training or only in test sets.    
```{r}
set.seed(120)
clinical_data_TCGA <- clinical_data_TCGA[sample(1:nrow(clinical_data_TCGA)),]
```
  
### Visualisation and cleaning
Plotting the distribution of the categorical features to detect patterns and get to know the data better.  
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(RColorBrewer)
nb.cols <- 33
mycolors <- colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(33, "Set3"))(nb.cols)

ggplot(clinical_data_TCGA, aes(x=as.factor(race), fill=as.factor(race))) + 
  geom_bar() + labs(title="Number of patients in each race", x = "Race") +
  theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 50, hjust = 1), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")

ggplot(clinical_data_TCGA, aes(x=as.factor(tumor_stage), 
                               fill=as.factor(tumor_stage))) + geom_bar() + 
  labs(title="Number of patients with each of the tumor stages", 
       x = "Tumor stage") +
theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 50, hjust = 1), 
      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = mycolors)

ggplot(clinical_data_TCGA, aes(x=as.factor(ethnicity), 
                               fill=as.factor(ethnicity))) + geom_bar() +
  labs(title="Number of patients in each ethnicity group", x = "ethnicity") +
  theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 50, hjust = 1), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")

ggplot(clinical_data_TCGA, aes(x=as.factor(gender), 
                               fill=as.factor(gender))) + geom_bar() +
  labs(title="Number of patients in each gender group", x = "Gender") +
  theme( plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")

ggplot(clinical_data_TCGA, aes(x=as.factor(vital_status), 
                               fill=as.factor(vital_status))) + geom_bar() +
  labs(title="Number of patients in each vital status", x = "Vital Status") +
  theme(axis.text.x =element_text( hjust = 1), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")


ggplot(clinical_data_TCGA, 
       aes(x=as.factor(treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy), 
           fill=as.factor(treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy))) + 
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title="Number of patients in pharmaceutical treatment or therapy", 
       x = "Pharmaceutical treatment or therapy") +
  theme(axis.text.x =element_text( hjust = 1), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```
  
To make these columns more informative, as i saw in the graphs above, the majority of the data is distributed in these two options. therefore i will change the "race" feature into white and not white(first plot), and the ethnicity (third plot) to "hispanic or latino" and "not hispanic or latino".  
```{r}
#change race to white and not white
clinical_data_TCGA$race <-
  ifelse(clinical_data_TCGA$race == "white", 1, 0)

#change ethnicity to hispanic or latino and not hispanic or latino
clinical_data_TCGA$hispanic_or_latino <-
  ifelse(clinical_data_TCGA$ethnicity == "not hispanic or latino", 0, 1)
clinical_data_TCGA <- clinical_data_TCGA %>% dplyr::select(-ethnicity)
```
  
Looking at features left for modeling and describing them:

```{r}
colnames(clinical_data_TCGA)
```
**_tissue_or_organ_of_origin_** -  the anatomic site of origin, of the patient's malignant disease.  
**_prior_malignancy_** - yes/no if a patient had a prior malignancy.  
**_year_of_diagnosis_** - Numeric value to represent the year of an individual's initial pathologic diagnosis of cancer.  
**_Tumor stage_** - Stage group determined from clinical information on the tumor (T), regional node (N) and metastases (M) and by grouping cases with similar prognosis for cancer. 
**_prior_treatment_** - yes/no if a patient had a prior cancer treatment.  
**_morphology_** - enum where each represents the biopsy morphology.  
**_site_of_resection_or_biopsy_** - organ of resection or biopsy.  
**_synchronous_malignancy_** - A yes/no/unknown indicator used to describe whether the patient had an additional malignant diagnosis at the same time the tumor used for sequencing was diagnosed.  
**_age_at_diagnosis_** - Age at the time of diagnosis expressed in number of days since birth.  
**_primary_diagnosis_** - The patient's histologic diagnosis, as described by the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O).  
**_race_** - If the patient is white or not.  
**_vital_status_** - dead or alive.  
**_gender_** - patients gender.  
**_year_of_birth_** - Numeric value to represent the calendar year in which an individual was born.  
**_age_at_index_** - The patient's age (in years) on the reference or anchor date date used during date obfuscation.  
**_treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy_** - yes/no if a patient had pharmaceutical treatment or therapy.  
**_treatments_radiation_treatment_or_therapy_** - yes/no if a patient had radiation or therapy.  
**_disease_** - project name.  
**_hispanic_or_latino_** - If the patient is hispanic or latino.  
  

Turning age in days to years scale to create a identical scale for visualization with all other numerical features which are in years.
  
```{r}
clinical_data_TCGA$age_at_diagnosis <- 
  clinical_data_TCGA$age_at_diagnosis / 365
summary(clinical_data_TCGA$age_at_diagnosis) 
```

Plotting the distribution of the numerical features.  
```{r}
ggplot(clinical_data_TCGA, aes(x=year_of_diagnosis, fill=year_of_diagnosis)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title="Year of diagnosis distribution", x = "Years") +
  theme(axis.text.x =element_text(angle = 50, hjust = 0.5), 
        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = mycolors)


ggplot(clinical_data_TCGA, aes(x=age_at_diagnosis)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title="Age at diagnosis distribution", x = "Years") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

ggplot(clinical_data_TCGA, aes(x=year_of_birth)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title="Year of birth distribution", x = "Years") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

ggplot(clinical_data_TCGA, aes(x=age_at_index)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +
  labs(title="Patient's age distribution", x = "Years") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
  
Except from "Year of diagnosis distribution" seems to distribute normaly or a little incline to left or right.  
Year of diagnosis distribution has a long left tail.  
  
  
Looking at categorical features to detect and manage missing data:
```{r}
round(prop.table(table(clinical_data_TCGA$
                         treatments_radiation_treatment_or_therapy))*100, 
      digits = 1)
round(prop.table(table(clinical_data_TCGA$vital_status))*100, digits = 1)
round(prop.table(table(clinical_data_TCGA$synchronous_malignancy))*100, 
      digits = 1)
round(prop.table(table(clinical_data_TCGA$prior_malignancy))*100, digits = 1)
round(prop.table(table(clinical_data_TCGA$prior_treatment))*100, digits = 1)
round(prop.table(table(clinical_data_TCGA$gender))*100, digits = 1)
```
  
In order to avoid loosing more data i am substituting the not reported into no, and adding a column of not reported as: if yes: 1, 0 otherwise, in all columns with yes/no/not reported. and checking the percentage again.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
clinical_data_TCGA$treatments_radiation_treatment_or_therapy_not_reported <-
  ifelse(clinical_data_TCGA$
           treatments_radiation_treatment_or_therapy == "not reported", 1, 0)
clinical_data_TCGA$treatments_radiation_treatment_or_therapy[
  clinical_data_TCGA$
    treatments_radiation_treatment_or_therapy == "not reported"] <- "no"


#Since this is the predicting class i am not going to add a not reported column
clinical_data_TCGA$treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy[
  clinical_data_TCGA$
    treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy == "not reported"] <- "no"

clinical_data_TCGA$prior_malignancy_not_reported <-
  ifelse(clinical_data_TCGA$prior_malignancy == "not reported", 1, 0)
clinical_data_TCGA$
  prior_malignancy[clinical_data_TCGA$prior_malignancy == 
                     "not reported"] <- "no"

# since there are only 4 not reported, 
#i will not add a "not reported column for this category, 
#as all of it, except for 4 values will be zeros.
clinical_data_TCGA$prior_treatment[clinical_data_TCGA$
                                     prior_treatment == "Not Reported"] <- "no"

clinical_data_TCGA$vital_status_not_reported <-
  ifelse(clinical_data_TCGA$vital_status == "Not Reported", 1, 0)
clinical_data_TCGA$vital_status[clinical_data_TCGA$
                                  vital_status == "Not Reported"] <- "Dead"
```

Removed "synchronous_malignancy" and "prior_treatment" since almost all (more than 98%) of the values in both are "no" therefore inclined and can affect the outcome of the algorithms. 
```{r}
clinical_data_TCGA <- 
  clinical_data_TCGA %>% dplyr::select(-synchronous_malignancy, -prior_treatment)

clinical_data_TCGA <- droplevels(clinical_data_TCGA)
```
  
```{r}
sum(is.na(clinical_data_TCGA))
```
There is no more NA's and missing data was managed.  
  
I would like to predict whether the patient will have pharmaceutical treatment or therapy,    
If i could predict this feature, knowing if a patient will go through radiation or pharmaceutical treatment can help determine the best adjuvant therapy if needed and as soon as possible, even before the treatment beginning.  
Bellow is the percentage of this class to verify they are more or less even and the data is not inclined to one of them.   
And they are so i can move forward.  
```{r}
round(prop.table(table(clinical_data_TCGA$
                         treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy))*100, 
      digits = 1)
```

  
### Narmalization and last preparations
Most of the data is categorical, therefore i will use one hot encoder from the "caret" package on these features.  
The fullRank option marked true allows redundant columns to be removed. for example- if the categorical data has only "yes"/"no" there will be one column created as yes and there will be 1 if the value was yes and 0 if the value was no.  
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
dummies_model <- dummyVars(treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy ~ ., 
                           data=clinical_data_TCGA, fullRank=T)

Data_mat <- predict(dummies_model, newdata = clinical_data_TCGA)

clinical_data_TCGA_bin <- data.frame(Data_mat)
clinical_data_TCGA_bin$treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy <-
  clinical_data_TCGA$treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy
```
  
Since there are only 4 rows with added NA's during prediction, and this will not affect the results significantly, i will omit them.
```{r}
sum(is.na(clinical_data_TCGA_bin))
clinical_data_TCGA_bin <- na.omit(clinical_data_TCGA_bin)
```

Normalize the numeric columns: year_of_diagnosis, age_at_diagnosis, year_of_birth, age_at_index for values between 0 and 1.
```{r}
#create the normalization function:
normalize <- function(x) {
return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
}
clinical_data_TCGA_bin$year_of_diagnosis <- 
  normalize(as.numeric(clinical_data_TCGA_bin$year_of_diagnosis))
clinical_data_TCGA_bin$age_at_diagnosis <- 
  normalize(as.numeric(clinical_data_TCGA_bin$age_at_diagnosis))
clinical_data_TCGA_bin$year_of_birth <- 
  normalize(as.numeric(clinical_data_TCGA_bin$year_of_birth))
clinical_data_TCGA_bin$age_at_index <- 
  normalize(as.numeric(clinical_data_TCGA_bin$age_at_index))

summary(c(clinical_data_TCGA_bin$year_of_diagnosis, 
          clinical_data_TCGA_bin$age_at_diagnosis, 
          clinical_data_TCGA_bin$year_of_birth, 
          clinical_data_TCGA_bin$age_at_index))
```
  
```{r, message=FALSE}
#move predicting column to be the first
clinical_data_TCGA_bin <- clinical_data_TCGA_bin %>% 
  dplyr::select(treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy, everything())

skim(clinical_data_TCGA)
```
  

  
### Dimensionality reduction:  
### PCA  
Looking for patterns in the whole data, by finding correlations between variables.  
PC1 and PC2 explain the highest variability in the data.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
pca <- prcomp(clinical_data_TCGA_bin[2:ncol(clinical_data_TCGA_bin)])
```
  
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(factoextra)
# Changing the direction of the eigenvectors (they are negative by default)
pca$rotation <- - pca$rotation
pca$x <- - pca$x
str(pca)
biplot(pca, scale = 0)
# calculating variance of each PC by squared the std
VE <- pca$sdev^2
PVE <- VE / sum(VE)
round(PVE, 2)

#visualization of pca
fviz_pca_ind(pca, geom.ind = "point", pointshape = 21, 
             pointsize = 2, 
             fill.ind = clinical_data_TCGA_bin$
               treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy, 
             col.ind = "black", 
             palette = "jco", 
             addEllipses = TRUE,
             label = "var",
             col.var = "black",
             repel = TRUE,
             legend.title = "Pharmaceutical/therapy") +
  ggtitle("2D PCA-plot TCGA clinical dataset") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
![](PCA.jpg)  
  
### tSNE
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(Rtsne)
tsne <- Rtsne(clinical_data_TCGA_bin, 
              check_duplicates = FALSE, pca=FALSE,perplexity=30,theta=0.0)

tsne <- data.frame(tsne$Y)
plot(tsne, col=clinical_data_TCGA_bin$
       treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy)

```
![](tSNE.jpg)


Now that the data is ready and i can create training and test sets.  
I will not use the outcome of PCA or of tSNE since it didn't help in dimension reduction but helped me see the data complexity.  
```{r, warning=FALSE}
#80% of the data will be in the training set, the rest in test.
trainRowNumbers <- 
  createDataPartition(clinical_data_TCGA_bin$
                        treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy, 
                      p=0.8, list=FALSE)

trainData <- clinical_data_TCGA_bin[trainRowNumbers,]
testData <- clinical_data_TCGA_bin[-trainRowNumbers,]

train_labels = trainData$treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy
test_labels = testData$treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy
```  
  
### RFE - Recursive Backword Feature Selection  
Feature selection algorithm using random forest with 4 options for number of features - 10, 300, 500 and all.  
Printing out the outcome and the selected features.  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(100)
options(warn=-1)

subsets <- c(10, 300, 500, 623)

ctrl <- rfeControl(functions = rfFuncs,
                   method = "repeatedcv",
                   repeats = 5,
                   verbose = FALSE)

lmProfile <- caret::rfe(x=trainData, 
                        y=trainData$
                          treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy,
                        sizes = subsets,
                        rfeControl = ctrl)
lmProfile
predictors(lmProfile)
```
![](FS.jpg)
  
### KNN  
First, i will run knn with k=1 to 40 to see which k will give me the best outcome.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
model = train(treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy ~ ., 
              data=trainData, method='knn', tuneLength = 40)
fitted <- predict(model, testData, type="prob")

plot(model, main="Model Accuracies with knn")
```
  

![](KNN.jpg)

Looks like the best is 7 neighbors.  
Running KNN with k = 7 to evaluate the outcome:

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(class)
knn_pred <- knn(train = trainData[2:ncol(trainData)], 
                      test = testData[2:ncol(testData)], 
                      cl =train_labels , k=(7))
confusionMatrix(test_labels, knn_pred, dnn = c('Test Data', 'Predicted'))
```
  
About 80% accuracy.  That's not bad and this seems to be the best outcome i can get with knn. 

### Naive beyes  

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(e1071)
nb_model <- naiveBayes(treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy ~ ., 
                       data = trainData)
nb_mod_pred <- predict(nb_model, testData)

confusionMatrix(test_labels, nb_mod_pred, dnn = c('Test Data', 'Predicted'))


#converting predict object into prediction object
nb_prediction <- prediction(as.numeric(nb_mod_pred), as.numeric(test_labels))
#calculating performance total
perf_nb <- ROCR::performance(nb_prediction, "tpr", "fpr")

#calculating auc
auc <- performance(nb_prediction, "auc")
# now converting S4 class to vector
auc <- unlist(slot(auc, "y.values"))
# adding min and max ROC AUC to the center of the plot
maxauc<-max(round(auc, digits = 2))
maxauct <- paste(c("max(AUC) = "),maxauc,sep="")
plot(perf_nb, col="red",colorize=F, main="ROC curve - Naive beyes model")
line=abline(0,1, col="blue")
legend(0.05,0.9,c(maxauct,"\n"),border="white",cex=1.0,box.col = "white")

confusionMatrix(test_labels, knn_pred, dnn = c('Test Data', 'Predicted'))
```

This model is much worse.  
It's not bad at predicting yes but very bad at predicting no - only about 30% correct prediction.  
Also the ROC curve is almost like the random line and AUS is almost 0.5.
  
### Disicion tree  

```{r}
library(C50)
disicion_tree_model <- 
  C50::C5.0(trainData[2:ncol(trainData)], 
            trainData$treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy)
disicion_tree_model

disicion_tree_model_predict <- predict(disicion_tree_model, testData)



tree_prediction <- prediction(as.numeric(disicion_tree_model_predict), 
                              as.numeric(test_labels))
perf_tree <- ROCR::performance(tree_prediction, "tpr", "fpr")

auc <- performance(tree_prediction, "auc")
# now converting S4 class to vector
auc <- unlist(slot(auc, "y.values"))
# adding min and max ROC AUC to the center of the plot
maxauc<-max(round(auc, digits = 2))
maxauct <- paste(c("max(AUC) = "),maxauc,sep="")
plot(perf_tree, col="red", main="ROC curve - disicion tree model")
line=abline(0,1, col="blue")
legend(0.6,0.3,c(maxauct,"\n"),border="white",cex=1.0,box.col = "white")


confusionMatrix(test_labels, disicion_tree_model_predict, 
                dnn = c('Test Data', 'Predicted'))
```

Correct prediction for about 81%. since most of the values in this data are 1 or 0, as yes or no, it is very intuitive that a decision tree would give good predictions.  
The auc is not bad.
I will try to improve these results using random forest.  

### Boosted- random forest with 20 trees  
```{r}
random_forst_model <- 
  C50::C5.0(trainData[2:ncol(trainData)], 
            trainData$treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy, trials=20)
random_forst_model

random_forest_model_predict <- predict(random_forst_model, testData)

forest_prediction <- prediction(as.numeric(random_forest_model_predict), 
                                as.numeric(test_labels))
perf_forest <- ROCR::performance(forest_prediction, "tpr", "fpr")

auc <- performance(forest_prediction, "auc")
# now converting S4 class to vector
auc <- unlist(slot(auc, "y.values"))
# adding max ROC AUC to the plot
maxauc<-max(round(auc, digits = 2))
maxauct <- paste(c("max(AUC) = "),maxauc,sep="")
plot(perf_forest, col="red", main="ROC curve - random forest model")
line=abline(0,1, col="blue")
legend(0.6,0.3,c(maxauct,"\n"),border="white",cex=1.0,box.col = "white")

confusionMatrix(test_labels, random_forest_model_predict, 
                dnn = c('Test Data', 'Predicted'))
```
  
This result is more or less the same prediction percentage as a single tree, 
but a little better, about 82%.  
AUC is higher.
  
### Linear kernel SVM
The vanilladot kernel applies a simple linear kernel.
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(kernlab)
svm_model <- ksvm(treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy ~ ., 
                  data=trainData, kernel="vanilladot")
svm_model_predict <- predict(svm_model, testData)


vanilla_prediction <- prediction(as.numeric(svm_model_predict), 
                                 as.numeric(test_labels))
perf_vanilla <- ROCR::performance(vanilla_prediction, "tpr", "fpr")

auc <- performance(vanilla_prediction, "auc")
# now converting S4 class to vector
auc <- unlist(slot(auc, "y.values"))
# adding min and max ROC AUC to the center of the plot
maxauc<-max(round(auc, digits = 2))
maxauct <- paste(c("max(AUC) = "),maxauc,sep="")
plot(perf_vanilla, col="red", main="ROC curve - SVM linear model")
line=abline(0,1, col="blue")
legend(0.6,0.3,c(maxauct,"\n"),border="white",cex=1.0,box.col = "white")


confusionMatrix(test_labels, svm_model_predict, 
                dnn = c('Test Data', 'Predicted'))
```
  
The svm algorithm, using a simple linear kernel is not bad 
but also not the best so far. resulting in about 77%.  
I will try to improve using other kernels.  
  
### Gaussian Radial basis function kernel SVM
The rbfdot kernel is the standard Gaussian Radial basis function:
```{r}
svm_model <- ksvm(treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy ~ ., 
                  data=trainData, kernel="rbfdot")
svm_model_predict <- predict(svm_model, testData)

rbf_prediction <- prediction(as.numeric(svm_model_predict), 
                             as.numeric(test_labels))
perf_rbf <- ROCR::performance(rbf_prediction, "tpr", "fpr")

auc <- performance(rbf_prediction, "auc")
# now converting S4 class to vector
auc <- unlist(slot(auc, "y.values"))
# adding min and max ROC AUC to the center of the plot
maxauc<-max(round(auc, digits = 2))
maxauct <- paste(c("max(AUC) = "),maxauc,sep="")
plot(perf_rbf, col="red", 
     main="ROC curve - SVM Gaussian Radial basis function model")
line=abline(0,1, col="blue")
legend(0.6,0.3,c(maxauct,"\n"),border="white",cex=1.0,box.col = "white")

confusionMatrix(test_labels, svm_model_predict, 
                dnn = c('Test Data', 'Predicted'))
```
  
This outcome is much better- around 82%.  
  
### Polynomial kernel SVM
Polydot is the simple polynomial kernel.  
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
svm_model <- ksvm(treatments_pharmaceutical_treatment_or_therapy ~ ., 
                  data=trainData, kernel="polydot")
svm_model_predict <- predict(svm_model, testData)

poly_prediction <- prediction(as.numeric(svm_model_predict), 
                              as.numeric(test_labels))
perf_poly <- ROCR::performance(poly_prediction, "tpr", "fpr")

auc <- performance(poly_prediction, "auc")
# now converting S4 class to vector
auc <- unlist(slot(auc, "y.values"))
# adding min and max ROC AUC to the center of the plot
maxauc<-max(round(auc, digits = 2))
maxauct <- paste(c("max(AUC) = "),maxauc,sep="")
plot(perf_poly, col="red", main="ROC curve - SVM polynomial model")
line=abline(0,1, col="blue")
legend(0.6,0.3,c(maxauct,"\n"),border="white",cex=1.0,box.col = "white")


confusionMatrix(test_labels, svm_model_predict, 
                dnn = c('Test Data', 'Predicted'))
```
  
This outcome is more or less like the vanilla dot.  

### K-Means Elbow method  
K-Means is a non supervised clustering algorithm. using the **elbow method** i will try to detect the best k:
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
library(purrr)
#Elbow Method for finding the optimal number of clusters
set.seed(123)
# Compute and plot wss for k = 2 to k = 20.
k.max <- 20
data <- clinical_data_TCGA_bin_z
wss <- sapply(1:k.max, 
              function(k){kmeans(data, k, 
                                 nstart=25,iter.max = 30 )$tot.withinss})
plot(1:k.max, wss,
     type="b", pch = 19, frame = FALSE, 
     xlab="Number of clusters K",
     ylab="Total within-clusters sum of squares")
```
![](KMEANS.jpg)
  
  
Since there is no elbow- the higher  the k the better the outcome i 
will see what happens with k 3,4,5.  
  
### K-Means k=3
Try with k=3:
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(stats)
library(factoextra)
set.seed(120)
clinical_data_TCGA_bin_z <- 
  scale(clinical_data_TCGA_bin[2:ncol(clinical_data_TCGA)])

kmeans_3 <- kmeans(clinical_data_TCGA_bin_z, 3, nstart=25)
str(kmeans_3)

fviz_cluster(kmeans_3, data = clinical_data_TCGA_bin_z)
```
  
I will try to improve.
  
### K-Means k=4
Try with k=4:  
```{r}
set.seed(120)
kmeans_4 <- kmeans(clinical_data_TCGA_bin_z, 4, nstart=25)
str(kmeans_4)

fviz_cluster(kmeans_4, data = clinical_data_TCGA_bin_z)
```
  
There are clusters which is not bad, i will try with a higher k.  
  
### K-Means k=5
Try with k=5:
```{r}
kmeans_5 <- kmeans(clinical_data_TCGA_bin_z, 5, nstart=25)
str(kmeans_5)

fviz_cluster(kmeans_5, data = clinical_data_TCGA_bin_z)
```
  
There are more clusters - this supports the elbow method- the higher the better. 

### Conclusions:  
1. PCA/tSNE did not help with dimension reduction  
but it did help me see the data is not linear and understand its structure better. 
2. Feature selection algorithm has long computational running time - about 4 days and might be challenging to use on this data.
3. Naive beyes is not a good algorithm for this data and the chosen classes as the results indicate.
4. KNN with 7 neighbors gives a good outcome with about 80% accuracy.
5. SVM â€“ Gaussian is the best from the tested kernels with 81% accuracy.
6. Random forest is better than a single tree and best of all algorithms.
7. K-Meansâ€“ the higher the better.

The algorithm i would use to determine if a patient will get pharmaceutical  
treatment or radiotherapy â€“ Random forest with 82% accuracy and 0.81 AUC.
